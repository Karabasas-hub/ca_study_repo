Since Azure is a cloud-based platform - ensuring safe and secure usage is paramount.

Setting up and using various authentication methods like Azure Active Directory and multi-factor authentication is
common practice for safe usage of Azure. You can also implement conditional access policies to issue access based
on location, device or risk level. Additionally - role-based access control ensures assigning the minimum possible
permissions for each role following the least privillege principle.

From the development side Azure provides a key vault for storing and managing secrets like passwords and API keys. 
It is recommended to regularly rotate secrets periodically. Use the Azure-provided monitoring tools to follow when 
passwords need to be changed or patches/updates installed.

Use various encryption tools that Azure provdies to protect your data and resources. Also enforce TLS for in-transit encryption.

Also make use of various options for securing networks, controlling traffic and creating/applying firewalls.

From network side you should segment your network implementing network security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic.
Apply various rules to VMs to keep them protected.
Deploy a firewall to protect the entirety of your Vnet, enable DDoS protection.
Make use of VPNs for safe connections between VMs or applications. Make endpoints private, utilise private IP addresses, 
making sure the traffic never leaves Azure network.

And as always - periodically make backups of your VMs, monitor your traffic, apply latest patches, keep all the software
and tools updated and keep disaster training and methodology up-to-date to ensure the best use of Azure.
