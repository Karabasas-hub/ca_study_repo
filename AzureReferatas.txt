The Azure SQL Database and traditional SQL Server databases while simmilar in principle - differ quite a bit.

Azure databases are cloud deployed and managed fully by microsoft. Its a lot more automated. While SQL servers are user-managed, offering more flexibility
and customisation/configuration oppurtunities. The traditional SQL can be deployed on physical machines as well.

Traditional SQL databases cost more to run, considering hardware requirements, software licences, maintenance and scaling costs. Azure on the other hand offers
a pay-as-you-go model based on selected configuration of the database.

The Azure SQL databases are scaled much more easily and can be scaled back down whenever needed with minimal cost as opposed to traditional SQL servers.

Azure SQL provides high availability and automatic disaster recovery because of the built it georedundancy.

The list goes on and on. 

In principle - the Azure SQL databases provide easier management, easier configuration, deployment and scaling. While traditional SQL servers provide more versitile
deployment and use options. In the end of the day though - it comes down to preference in my opinion. For saving time and money - the Azure SQL is certainly the
way to go. On the other hand - for very specific circumstances and use-cases - it might be more beneficial to stick with the traditional SQL servers.
